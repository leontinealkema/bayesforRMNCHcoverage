# Overview

## Background

Why would we want to introduce Bayesian statistical models to produce estimates and forecasts for Countdown coverage indicators?

## Training content

The training is divided into 5 modules:

1.  Introduction to Bayesian inference and Bayesian modeling in global health

2.  How to exchange information between populations: Hierarchical models (also called multilevel models)

3.  How to best use data to inform estimates: Data models for survey and routine surveillance data  

4.  What assumptions to make about indicators and how they change with time: Time series process models, focused on transition models 

5.  Putting it all together: Using Bayesian hierarchical transition models for model fitting, how to go about it, what to check?

In each module, topics include conceptual understanding as well as hands-on analysis and modeling exercises. The schedule can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vROdU0FX10fhCk6MeEwB6XQ0m4o_HNY4KhQQ7y77XkAnUtfafx-3fiNrO-VZ4VEmMvgldmKYRt6_ye0/pubhtml?gid=1779572550&single=true "Schedule").
