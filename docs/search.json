    "text": "Welcome to the website of the Countdown Bayesian statistical modeling capacity strengthening and analysis project!\nThe goal of the 2024 Countdown Bayesian statistical modeling capacity strengthening and analysis project is to introduce statistical models to produce estimates and forecasts for Countdown coverage indicators. Focus is on a general class of Bayesian hierarchical temporal models that includes FPET, a model that is used for estimating and forecasting family planning indicators such as modern contraceptive use, based on survey and routine data. \nThe project includes a training and analysis component. In the training part of this project, participants will be introduced to Bayesian models, with specific applications to using a Bayesian hierarchical temporal model like FPET for estimation and forecasting of indicators at the national and subnational level.  The training aims to provide a conceptual understanding of Bayesian models. Additional training objectives include data exploration and model fitting, using open-source software R and Stan for computation. By the end of the training, participants can fit models to new indicators of interest, interpret and check results, and modify the modeling approach as relevant. \nThe analysis component takes place as part of the training and continues afterwards to finalize models to be used for CAM2025. Analyses and model development will focus on the percentage of births in facilities and immunization coverage (PENTA3). Coverage related to antenatal care (ANC4) may be considered as well. The modeling will focus on national and admin1 estimates and, where possible, estimates at lower levels of disaggregation.\nAll materials are licensed under CC-BY-NC 4.0.

    "text": "Step 2: Download the BayesCoverageTraining material from github\nAll code for this course will be made available in a public repository (repo) on Github: https://github.com/AlkemaLab/BayesCoverageTraining.  \nThe text below introduces Github and a workflow for non-Github users. Participants who are familiar with github can ignore that workflow and work with the repository directly. \n\nInstructions for those new to Github\nGithub refers to a hosting service for projects that use a version control system (git). Many programming projects, such as R packages, use Github repositories and the git version control system such that several people can work together and contribute to the project. Rstudio has nice functionality to work with and contribute to Github repositories. However, it requires some learning to get started with it. Hence, to avoid too much learning at once, we introduce a workflow that does not require any knowledge or experience with git(hub) for new users. If you are interested in learning more about git and github, some resources are provided below. We may come back to the use of github when doing collaborative analysis projects.\n\nWhen downloading the code for the first time, take the following steps:\n\nDownload the repo \n\n\nGo to https://github.com/AlkemaLab/BayesCoverageTraining\nClick on “Code” (green button), then “download zip”, see screenshot 1 below.\n\n\n\nSet up your local folder with your Rstudio project \n\n\nPlace the zipped downloaded file in a place where you can find it again: this directory will contain all your R code for the training\nUnzip the downloaded file\nClick on “BayesCoverageTraining.Rproj” to open your project in R studio, see screenshot 2.\n\n\n\n\nCode updates/additions:\nNew modules will be added as the training progresses. To get the code in your local BayesCoverageTraining folder, you will need to download the new module and add it. \nTo do so, we recommend just downloading the entire repository again as per step A above, unzipping, and then selecting the folder that you want to move to your local BayesCoverageTraining folder. (But if you want, note that you can also download individual files (just click on the file you want, and then there is a download button [downwards arrow] in the top left)."

Here is a post with several examples and a two-page cheat sheet in the end.\nhttps://www.hertiecodingclub.com/learn/rstudio/stata_to_r/\nJust good to keep in mind that the way R works is somewhat different from the way Stata does (in terms of structure, environment and objects). So not everything can be translated or thought as if we were coding in Stata."
